        <h1 id='CPS'>Curriculum Equity Initiative Intern - Chicago Public Schools </h1>
        <p>I have had an amazing experience working for Chicago Public Schools’ Curriculum Equity Initiative for 6 months. CPS has been creating an entirely new curriculum in order to ensure that every student, 
          at every school in the city, has access to quality learning materials and assessments, an issue that means a lot to me as a former CPS student. The past few months I have been reviewing K-12 assessments 
          in Math, English Language, Social Studies, and World Language (Spanish and French), looking through every question to make sure it can be easily understood, covers the necessary content standards, 
          has a fair point value, and all technical aspects are fully functional. I have been able to see how my feedback has actually led to improving the quality of these assessments. I also collected data on 
          each assessment and analyzed it to ensure that students are learning content that will help them succeed at every lesson, unit, and interim level. The Curriculum Equity Initiative also focuses on inclusivity in its learning materials, 
          so I have really enjoyed being able to see the amount of representation included in English Language texts to a widened scope of history being taught in Social Studies classes so that students can learn about a broad variety of perspectives,
           while still being able to relate to content as Chicago Public School students. My work has allowed me to see all of the details that go into the process of shaping a curriculum that truly has the students’ best interest in mind. </p>

        <h1 id='89.3'> General Manager - WNUR 89.3 FM </h1>
        <p>As General Manager of WNUR, Northwestern’s student radio station, I was in charge of running the entire station, along with it's 8 media content areas. My responsibilities included everything from technological upkeep of the station, scheduling of shows, event planning, marketing, individual communication with DJs, and leading exec and stationwide meetings.  
          I have gained valuable leadership experience as the head of a radio station during a pandemic. Despite all of the challenges faced, I managed to continue 24-hour broadcasting throughout the pandemic, 
          as well as maintain community engagement in remote station activities. I organized a CD Exchange among members, a virtual benefit concert raising money for Chicago's Independent Venues League, and a screenprinting event using old station designs.
          I also was in charge of the station's yearly fundraiser, Phoneathon, which is the source of all of our revenue. In one week, we managed to raise over $35,000, despite the uncertainties of the pandemic. Before being General Manager, I was the Programming Director of the station, which involves scheduling shows and developing content creation. Next year, I will be stepping down as head of the station 
          to be the Music Director of Rock Show, the content block I have been DJing for since freshman year. </p>

        <h1 id='dittmar'> Gallery Assistant - Dittmar Gallery </h1>
        <p>As a Gallery Assistant at Northwestern’s Dittmar Gallery, I was responsible for managing all events that take place in the gallery, which involved coordinating with clients, catering services and school officials in order to ensure each event goes smoothly. I also filed the hundreds of exhibition submissions the gallery receives yearly. 
          Each aspect of the artist’s exhibit (medium, message, visuals) must be evaluated each of them according to the gallery’s mission in order to choose 4-6 exhibits for the year. This experience made me much more organized, as well as more detail-oriented. I also helped develop a more efficient system of filing submissions to streamline the process.</p>

        <h1 id="iilp"> Diversity Project Intern - The Institute for Inclusion in the Legal Profession </h1>
        <p>As an intern with the Institute for Inclusion in the Legal Profession, my main project was interviewing law students about their experiences with diversity and inclusion in law school. 
          I then wrote up summaries of the interviews as individual blog posts and edited a video that showcased excerpts of my interviews, both of which are available at https://inclusionatwork.wordpress.com/. 
          I found this experience incredibly fascinating and am so grateful for the participants for giving me their trust and the opportunity to share their stories. The internship also helped me practice my writing skills and has given me confidence that I can work well with clients and truly listen to their needs. </p>

        <h1 id='nlg'> Volunteer - National Lawyers Guild </h1>
        <p>I also volunteered with the National Lawyers Guild Chicago Chapter, mainly in their communications department. I really enjoyed working with an organization that truly believed that law should be for the people, and worked hard to make sure everyone who needs representation receives it. 
          We were especially busy in June 2020, when so many BLM protesters were being arrested and unable to access legal aid. It was a very eye-opening experience to see the ways in which the legal system often works against the people it is meant to protect.</p>
