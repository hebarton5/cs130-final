        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> Welcome to my website! As a Political Science major with a minor in Data Science and experience in Media Art and Spanish, I have a very wide range of interests and skill sets. I am hoping that this website will better demonstrate my experience than a typical resume.</p>
        <p>At the core of all of my interests are history and politics. While I have considered law school after graduation, I am more interested in the non-profit and local government sectors. I have worked in areas such as legal justice, education, diversity and inclusion, and have enjoyed all of them. I intend to continue on a social justice- centered career path that can combine this passion with a vital understanding of technology and its effect on our lives. 
        </p>
        <p>My work in education with Chicago Public Schools, as well as my classes in digital interactive media, have turned my attention towards the museum industry and public art. I am interested in the idea of cultivating immersive, educational exhibits in spaces such as museums or other public sites as a way to combine interactive media art and education. This also ties into my interest in urban planning and the use of public spaces. I believe a lot of social change can happen just by creating pieces with meaning that bring people together in communal spaces. </p>
        <p>I have started learning more about computer and data science and intend to further these skills as much as I can. So far, I am familiar with Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Data collection and analysis is so important in so many contexts, as well as being able to convey that data in a visually pleasing way. I am very interested in web design and other ways to mix technology and art. 
        </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy my website and please feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborating!
